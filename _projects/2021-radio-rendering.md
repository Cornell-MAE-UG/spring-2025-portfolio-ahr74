As part of the Cornell Baja Racing Team, I worked on vehicle modeling with a focus on tire dynamics to improve performance and predictability in off-road conditions. Since tires are the primary interface between the vehicle and terrain, understanding their behavior under varying loads, slip conditions, and surface types was critical. I researched different models to help support design decisions, helping us optimize our vehicle's performance for dynamic competition events.
